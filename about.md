## What is Cub Scouting?

Cub Scouting is a program of Scouting America that builds character, teaches citizenship, and encourages personal fitness through engaging and age-appropriate activities.

Cub Scouting is geared towards kids enrolled in Kindergarten through 5th grade, with kids grouped into "Dens" for each grade level, typically up to 8 kids.  Cub Scout Dens perform fun activities and adventures throughout the year, earning awards and ranks along the way to recognize their achievements.

Parents and families are a key component of the Cub Scouting program, taking an active role in supporting the den and the activities they do together, and setting examples for youth of the Cub Scouting Values.
