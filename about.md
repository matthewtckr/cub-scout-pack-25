### Cub Halloween Campout

### Roar Before the 24 Daytona Campout

Join us at the "Roar Before the 24" weekend at the Daytona Speedway in January! Bring earplugs, get up-close with IMSA cars and drivers, and brave the 18-degree climb to sign your name on the finish line!

Come for the day or join us for tent camping, but be dressed for warm, cold, or rainy conditions.  Many other activities are available besides watching the races, including fishing in the Daytona Speedway's stocked lake and a tram tour of the speedway facility.

## Orlando Solar Bears Scout Night

The Scout Night for the Orlando Solar Bears Hockey team provides a fun opportunity for families.  Not only do they get to enjoy a great hockey game with the pack, the arena hosts an open-house before the game exclusively for scout units to meet the team mascot, Shades, get on the ice to score a goal, and talk with the team coaches.

## Spring Family Campout

Pack 25 hosts a family camping weekend at Moss Park, a beautiful Orange County Park within the Split Oak Forest near Lake Nona.  The campout offers a fun weekend, including activities such as a short hike along a section of the Florida National Scenic Trail, and an Easter Egg hunt around the campsite.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to do Cub Scouting?

The Cub Scouting program has annual registration fees for youth participants and adult volunteers.  This fee is used by the Scouting America and Central Florida Council organizations to cover program development costs and insurance to ensure a safe, quality program for all participants.  As of 2025, the annual registration fee for youth is $145.

Families that are unable to afford the annual registration fee are encouraged to reach out directly to the Pack 25 Cubmaster, either in-person or via email, to help coordinate with the Council for a reduced cost.

Pack 25 has an annual pack fee of $XX to help cover activity costs.  Additionally, the pack participates in Council Fundraisers such as "Camp Card" sales, to keep the pack fee low and cover costs like rank and activity awards for youth.

Cub Scouts are encouraged to wear the Cub Scouting uniform during pack meetings, to help reinforce the concept that youth are part of a team and as a way to show individual achievement by the awards they wear on the uniform.  Pack 25 recommends purchasing an official Cub Scouting shirt, typically one size larger, to help reduce costs.  Cub Scout shirts are commonly available at thrift stores and community marketplaces for much less than purchasing a new shirt directly from Scouting America.  Scouts may use any Navy Blue shorts or pants along with the Cub Scout shirt.

The Cub Scout program has recently switched program materials to be online-first.  This means that grade level-specific handbooks are not necessary for the program.  Parents are required to complete the ["Parent's Guide" for Youth Protection](https://www.scouting.org/training/youth/parents-guides/) each year, which is available online or in the front of any printed handbook.
