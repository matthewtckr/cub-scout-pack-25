## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to do Cub Scouting?

The Cub Scouting program has annual registration fees for youth participants and adult volunteers.  This fee is used by the Scouting America and Central Florida Council organizations to cover program development costs and insurance to ensure a safe, quality program for all participants.  As of 2025, the annual registration fee for youth is $145.

Families that are unable to afford the annual registration fee are encouraged to reach out directly to the Pack 25 Cubmaster, either in-person or via email, to help coordinate with the Council for a reduced cost.

Pack 25 has an annual pack fee of $XX to help cover activity costs.  Additionally, the pack participates in Council Fundraisers such as "Camp Card" sales, to keep the pack fee low and cover costs like rank and activity awards for youth.

Cub Scouts are encouraged to wear the Cub Scouting uniform during pack meetings, to help reinforce the concept that youth are part of a team and as a way to show individual achievement by the awards they wear on the uniform.  Pack 25 recommends purchasing an official Cub Scouting shirt, typically one size larger, to help reduce costs.  Cub Scout shirts are commonly available at thrift stores and community marketplaces for much less than purchasing a new shirt directly from Scouting America.  Scouts may use any Navy Blue shorts or pants along with the Cub Scout shirt.

The Cub Scout program has recently switched program materials to be online-first.  This means that grade level-specific handbooks are not necessary for the program.  Parents are required to complete the ["Parent's Guide" for Youth Protection](https://www.scouting.org/training/youth/parents-guides/) each year, which is available online or in the front of any printed handbook.
