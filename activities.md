## Pack 25 Highlights


### Cub Halloween Campout

### Roar Before the 24 Daytona Campout

Join us at the "Roar Before the 24" weekend at the Daytona Speedway in January! Bring earplugs, get up-close with IMSA cars and drivers, and brave the 18-degree climb to sign your name on the finish line!

Come for the day or join us for tent camping, but be dressed for warm, cold, or rainy conditions.  Many other activities are available besides watching the races, including fishing in the Daytona Speedway's stocked lake and a tram tour of the speedway facility.
