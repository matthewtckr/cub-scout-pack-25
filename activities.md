## Pack 25 Highlights


### Cub Halloween Campout

### Roar Before the 24 Daytona Campout

Join us at the "Roar Before the 24" weekend at the Daytona Speedway in January! Bring earplugs, get up-close with IMSA cars and drivers, and brave the 18-degree climb to sign your name on the finish line!

Come for the day or join us for tent camping, but be dressed for warm, cold, or rainy conditions.  Many other activities are available besides watching the races, including fishing in the Daytona Speedway's stocked lake and a tram tour of the speedway facility.

## Orlando Solar Bears Scout Night

The Scout Night for the Orlando Solar Bears Hockey team provides a fun opportunity for families.  Not only do they get to enjoy a great hockey game with the pack, the arena hosts an open-house before the game exclusively for scout units to meet the team mascot, Shades, get on the ice to score a goal, and talk with the team coaches.

## Spring Family Campout

Pack 25 hosts a family camping weekend at Moss Park, a beautiful Orange County Park within the Split Oak Forest near Lake Nona.  The campout offers a fun weekend, including activities such as a short hike along a section of the Florida National Scenic Trail, and an Easter Egg hunt around the campsite.
